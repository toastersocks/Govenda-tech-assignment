# Govenda Tech Assignment

Add a pexels.com API key to APIKey.xcconfig file after `API_KEY = `.
Make sure not to add quotes around the API key string.

The design is pretty rough, but it works.
Future tasks:

- Fix initial loading of the thumbnails blocks.
- Pull the navigation out of the view controllers and manage it via coordinators.
- Accessibility improvements. Especially the collection view is not accessible.
- Go all in on modern Swift async streams etc...
- Improve the spacing of the flow layout of the collection view.
- General design improvements.

Thanks you,

James Pamplona
